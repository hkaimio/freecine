My project for scnning Super8 films with a flatbed scanner

This is an old project I started for scanning my Super8 films using a flatbed scanner. I haven't been actively working with 
this for a long time. 

The project includes source code for the 
film mover firmware (it was built from LEGO Mindstorms NCT kit and programme using LeJOS Java virtual machine) and PC app for 
doing scanning and processing the scanned film strips into individual frames.
